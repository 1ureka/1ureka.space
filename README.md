This project is my personal portfolio website showcasing 3D CG works, with tools for image management and basic editing. Built using **Next.js**, it demonstrates modern web development practices like server-side rendering and component-driven architecture.

The frontend utilizes **Material UI** for design, **Framer Motion** for animations, and **Recoil** for state management. On the backend, **Neon Postgres** and **Prisma** manage data, while **NextAuth.js** provides authentication. **Sharp** handles image processing and optimization.
